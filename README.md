# Bike_sales_analysis

This project provides a data-driven approach to analyze bike sales and understand sales performance across various product categories. 
By leveraging SQL, we aggregate, filter, and rank data to generate insights useful for inventory management, pricing strategies, and sales optimization.

# Objectives
 1. To summarize product counts and identify high-value items based on pricing.
 2. Provide detailed sales insights by product category to inform inventory and marketing strategies.
 3. Highlight key trends within specific categories, such as "Mountain Bikes."
    
# Approach
The analysis is conducted through SQL queries designed to:

 * Aggregate product information.
 * Rank products by value.
 * Filter and categorize specific segments, such as mountain bikes.
 * Calculate and present sales data by category for a high-level view of performance.

# Key Queries
